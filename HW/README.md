# SoccerRobot
***

In this homwork we controll a Robot for play soccer, and we must design the suitable compensator to trcking a certian feature 

### PID Compensator
***
In the code designed for controlling the robot, a PID controller class is used, So all 4 types of controllers (P, PI, PD, PID) are attainable by changing the gains in objects created from this class. This class uses a member variable called sample-time, as soon as delta-time reaches the sample-time, it calculates the PTerm, the DTerm (deviding the error by delta-time) and the ITerm (using error summation) and defines the output as the sum of all this terms.
A P controller output is proportional to the error its input by a kp gain, so there is no Overshoot, decrease rise time and SS(Steady State) error. A PI controller uses an integrator to eliminate the steady state error but increase the overshoot and settling time. A PD contoller uses a derivative block to decrease the setteling time and overshoot of the process. A PID contoller is mixture of all the controllers explained above and can be used to achieve critically damped response with minimum final error.
### Discretization
For disceteization of every section of the PID contoller we can use the ZOH method, which consists of sampler with specific frequency.
### Deadzone
Deadzones causes the process error to become larger (the motor does not respond until the input gets to a specific value). for example if the deadzone bound for our DC motor is 0.5 and we use a P contorller with kp=10, the errors lower than 0.05 correspond to a value lowers than 0.5 for motor input.
## 1D Controller
***
### Code Functionality
In this section the user set the x_position and and robot must go to the desire y_position with small overshhot and fast.
## Angular Controller
***
### Code Functionality
In this code the heading of the robot is calculated with `self.get_compass_heading()` and angle of the robot changes (by turning the wheels against each other) to the desired heading
## 2D Controller
***
### Code Functionality
In this code, position of the robot is controlled with two same PID class, for controllig the distance between the robot and desired position and for controlling the angle difference.
## Ball Tracking Controller
***
### Code Functionality
In this code, 3 objects of the PID controller rotate the robot so the ball is in fornt of it by increaing FrontBack parameter if its lower than -0.6 `(ball_bata["direction"][0])` ,reduce robot angle with the ball `(ball_bata["direction"][1])` and increase the disatnce parameter `(ball_bata["strength"])` which is being feed to the controller as 1/distance. Robot motors use the formula derived in the class `(vr=(2v+Lw)/2R` and `vl=(2v-Lw)/2R)` in which v is the distance controller output and w is the theta controller output
